#PersonalBrandingWebsite
The project was to build a personal portfolio site (potentially for yourself) allowing site's users are recruiters considering to hire the applicant And to present self in best light and get hired.

Design Process
The design process of the website was to made it simple and not to complicated allowing users to browse through using side navgation bar from the left side to look at the content. It will help them to look at company job requirements and check whether the applicant meet the requirments for the job and interview.
As a user type, I want users to be able to enter their details throught "contact" page if they have enquires with ease of use.
As a user type, I want users to be able download of the applicant resume to look and veifry if the applicant have met the requirements for applying job in a specific company.
As a user type, I want users to be able easily access the webiste whether if users is using mutiple devices eg computers, phone, tablet...etc

Features:
Contact Page Form - allowing users to input their details through the form and if there is a empty form it will prompt an error message and for the users to key in the details.
Side Navagation Bar - allowing users to click on different buttons without having to scroll down the page.
Resume link - allowing users to click on the link to download the applicant resume to check if meet the requirements for the job.

Features Left to Implement
Adding a sub navagation to the education page to allow the users to look through the applicant history of all the certification that he had received.
Adding personal details beside the form so that users can just message or call to the author website.
Adding icons to the navgation page to allows the users to click and it redirect to author profile page to find out more information.

Technologies Used
HTML and CSS
The project uses html to code the layout of the design and using css to make it more responsive and interactive.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "About" page
Click on the "resume" link to check whether the file has been downloaded successfully.
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears 
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and it prompt the windows mail to put all the details in the email and prompt users click send email to the author of website.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

While doing this project, i encourted issues where i was not able to put the text beside the picture using flexboxs and for tempoary the picture will be below the text.
When opening the "index.html" file, remember to download and extract the resource files and placed inside the ID_S10208093K_Lim-Jin-Hui_Assg1_website folder if you want to see the picture and download resume from that folder.
